## Branches:
This project has many branches as it is helpful for me to track the progression and practice. It is merely for my own convenience. 

The purpose of each branch is as follows:

### main
Player vs. CPU
### multiplayer
multiplayer enabled
### express-multiplayer
multiplayer enabled using express to server both front and backend
### namespace
building on express-multiplayer by adding a namespace
### practice
practice branch for rebuilding the express server portion (will be deleted)
### rooms
building on namespace by adding rooms so multiple instances of multiplayer Pong is possible.
